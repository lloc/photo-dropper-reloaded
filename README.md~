Photo Dropper
=============

PhotoDropper lets you easily add free Creative Commons licensed photos to your posts from Flickr with just a few simple clicks allowing you to create professional high quality posts that your readers will love.

This work bases on PhotoDropper 1.0.9 by photodropper and artofblog which was the last version I liked.
